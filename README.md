# Restaurant Backend Rest Application

A restaurant application in which clients, waiters and kitchen staff can interact together. Tables are checked-in, orders can be processed and communicated to the cooks. 
This is the backend piece, used to provide endpoints and send REST response to the frontend. This application was created entirely by Test-Driven-Development technique.
